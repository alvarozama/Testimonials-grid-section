## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In a sense, I feel like this project was an extension of the last one, so I'd say rather than learning something new, it helped reinforce the same things as I had previously put to use.

### Continued development

This time around I just couldn't figure out how to set te correct size for the entirety of the page, so I guess I still have to practice more in that regard. 

### Useful resources

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=181s] - Same video as the one I used as reference for the previous challenge. Here, Kevin Powell shows the fundamentals of CSS Grid by completing the very same challenge. I used a slightly different approach to his, and og course most of the CSS styling and the organizing of the HTML markup was done without looking at anything done by Mr. Powell.
